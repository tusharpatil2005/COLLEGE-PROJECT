            <li><h3>About RCPIT</h3></li>
        </ul>

        <p>R. C. Patel Institute of Technology was set up as a part of the self-powered plans of Shirpur Education Society in 2001 with the objective to erect a truly world class institute in the rural and tribal part where students from the vicinity would be benefited from the services that match global standards. RCPIT was conceived by visionary leader, Hon. Shri. Amrishbhai R. Patel, former cabinet minister for School Education, sports and Youth Welfare for Maharashtra State. The institute has grown at a remarkable pace and has  become an institute of repute within the country. It is spread on lush green land providing an ambience congenial to the pursuit of high quality technical education. Every single detail of the institute has been implemented at par with global standards in accordance to the norms of AICTE, New Delhi. The strength of RCPIT lies in its state of art Laboratories, IIT virtual Classrooms & Laboratories, Digital Library, and Suporting Environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An Autonomous Institute of DBATU, Lonere <br>
            Grade 'A' by NAAC, Bengaluru <br>
            Grade 'A' by University <br>
            Accredited by TATA Consultancy Services</p>
            <br>
            <p>The success of RCPIT is largely attributed to the exuberant faculty members who are rich in qualification, high in spirits, disciplined and devoted to the core. Perhaps the most productive and effective method of teaching and monitoring is the one implemented at this institute, called â€“ Tutor System, wherein, a batch of students are entrusted to a teacher for not just instruction but as much for care, parenting and counseling. Problems faced by the students are thus resolved and even the head of the department pitches in to help. In addition there are periodical appraisal and evaluation of students and teachers (by the students). This methodology ensures that the students feature in the University Merit List during each and every academic year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The institute has highly qualified professionals from the reputed institutes like I.I.T.s who are devoted, committed and dedicated to the core. Besides, they possess rich of experience in their respective streams and many of them have presented technical papers at National and International levels.</p>
